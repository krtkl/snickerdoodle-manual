# snickerdoodle documentation

Welcome to the documentation of krtkl. In this repository you'll find everything you need to know to get you started. 

To become familiar with your snickerdoodle have a look at the [snickerdoodle user manual][manual]. It provides you a good overview of the functionality of your board. 

Next you should prepare your microSD card [here][sdcard]. 


Instructions to install the required software for developing on the zynq can be found [here][xil_inst]. 

These guides, available for [Windows][sdk_dev_win] and [Linux][sdk_dev_lnx], will get you started with the Xilinx SDK workflow to run your first 'hello world' linux applicaion on your snickerdoodle!. 

[This][hw_dev_lnx] guide will help you set up the Vivado design suite for your snickerdoodle and get you started developing hardware definitions.
